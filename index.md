# About

Currently, I'm a Research Assistant in the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), advised by [Benjamin Van Durme](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/). Before that, I worked in [Beth Irsarel Deaconess Medical Center](https://www.bidmc.org/) at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/). 
My recent research focuses on image recognition, medical data analysis, natural language processing. I am also interested in linguistic semantics.
